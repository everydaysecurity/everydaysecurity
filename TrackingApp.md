<h2>Which kind of apps are used for intimate partner violence(IPV)?</h2>

- <strong>Spy applications</strong>
- <strong>Location tracking applications</strong>

While some application are malicious, others are designed to make our life easier by sharing the location of our loved ones. However, these are normally abused during IPV<br>

The <strong>spy app</strong> belongs the first category. These type of applications are designed to track the user while exposing their private information to others. The "spy" nature of this kind of application make the spying activity hard to trace.

The second category of application used during IPV falls in family & friends <strong>location sharing apps</strong>. Some of the most commonly used ones are <em>Life360</em>, <em>iMapp</em>, and <em>Glympse</em>. They were designed to better connect us with family members and close friends by sharing location with each other. <em>Life360</em>'s mission was to "...bring your family closer with smart features designed to protect and connect the people who matter most."

Location apps like Life360 can act like a double edged sword however, when an abuser within intimate relationship has access to their partner's phone, they can monitor the victim in a hidden and discrete way. Especially these apps generally can't be disabled unless the victim aware of. Additionally, some system apps can’t be uninstalled or disabled for security reasons and the user can’t block this system calls/notification.<br>

Another typical category of application is the misused security application, like the Children safety app or other patient monitor app.  For these apps, they are designed can’t be removed by the user under surveillance. Which means, even the victim find out they are monitored, they can't get rid of it by themselves.
