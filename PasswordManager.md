<h2>What is a Password Manager?</h2>
It’s a manager that keeps tracks of your passwords of different websites. Normally, it will keep all the password in an encrypted file in the computer or online that will not be visible to everyone. It remembers all your password online/offline in a “vault”. Some managers even help you create a password if needed.

<h2>Why do we need a password manager?</h2>
1.We tend to have lots of accounts on the internet.

2.Either they are all the same, and that’s not safe.

3.Or we cannot remember all of them.

<h2>Benefits</h2>
1.It keeps a list of your password of each website

2.It helps you create new computer-generated password

3.Remember ONLY one master password

4.It will auto fill your sign-in page.

5.Reset your password periodically.
Ex: 1Password, Dashlane, LastPass, Google/Apple built-in…

<h2>Limitations</h2>
1.There is ONLY one master password that can keep your whole list safe. It is very difficult to retrieve the master key, either two factor authentication or sometimes need to ask a friend to help you verify your identity (in some cases, there is no way to get the master key back).

2.Computer memory will leave a trail of password, hackers will find a different way to approach the data. Computer memory sometimes leaves a trail of what is left inside, and hackers could find a way to access the memory itself to retrieve the key.

3.Cloud-based password manager are exposed to higher security risk.

4.Phishing

5.Keyloggers are still a threat. Keylogger is a device that will remember what keys were clicked by the user and in this case, it will physically remember the password what user typed.

6. And it costs money

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
You should still use one.

It is safer than nothing. Don’t be at the bottom when you can step up(even just a little); better than not using one; password manager is safer than using repetitive and easy to remember passwords

It’s convenient. It will save the passwords for you so you don’t need to worry about which website using what password

Password Managers companies improve and implementing more and more secure/advanced algorithm to the mangers, keep everything up-to-date.

Hackers may spend more time on more valuable individuals. Not every user or individual is valuable to the hackers; Not every hacker would like to spend that much of a time to hack some random user.
