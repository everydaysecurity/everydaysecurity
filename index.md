### One citizen. One human error. One **nation** impacted.

An estimated <strong>80%</strong> of successful breaches occur because people unintentionally make a mistake or act insecurely.

In our own work, we found that **44%** of 1577 misuse incidents that lead to adversaries accessing patient records that were reported by the US Department of Health Human Service (HHS) were caused by human misuse/mistakes rather than software vulnerabilities. The general public --- from elementary school students to college students to software engineers to the general work force to executives to the oldest citizens on the planet that interact with technology --- need to be **persuaged** that cybersecurity threats <u>apply to them</u> and to **understand actions** they can make to <u>avoid making errors</u> and to <u>protect</u> themselves, their employer, their customers, their friends and neighbors, and even the nation.

Here, we will present you in an approachable and accessible way to the lastest information on cybersecurity in relation to everyday tasks and choices for the general public and the cybersecurity workforce.

Topics: included:
- Public Wi-Fi
- Personal VPN
- Password Manager
- Encryption
- etc.
