<h2>Reasons to Have a Strong Password</h2>
The most common way a person hacks into someone’s account is by guessing his/her password. Treat passwords as you would your physical keys you use to unlock your house.
So if you have a “Strong Password”
- It’s less likely for someone else to log into your account
- It protects your personal information

<h2>Guidelines for a Strong Password</h2>
- Do not include your name or your username
- Do not use a combination of dictionary words
- Easy to guess patterns do not work either: p@ssw0rd is too easy to guess
- At least 8 characters long (the more the better)
- Make sure it’s something that you will remember (if you have to write it down its not strong)
- A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters
- A mixture of letters and numbers
- Including at least 1 special character “@?<>{}[]()*&^%$#”
- <font color='red'>Make sure the password is only used on one account</font>

A good website to use is [How Secure is My Password](https://howsecureismypassword.net/) to see if your password is easy to hack or not

<h2>Storing Passwords</h2>
Remembering a plethora of passwords can be frustrating. A way to deal with this is to use a password manager.
- ex: [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/), [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/), Google Password Manager
For the password manager to be most efficient:
- Create a “Strong Password” for accessing the manager
- Terminate out of the manager completely when you are not using it (even if it is locked)
- Use two-factor authentication

<h2>How do I ensure my password protection stays safe?</h2>
- Never share your passwords with others
- It is okay to make your passwords unique to you personally, but make sure it is not something that is easily guessed
- Have a different unique password for each account/site
- Change your passwords often

In the end, hackers rely on the human instinct to guess passwords, so it’s up to you to be unpredictable and to protect your precious information.
