<li>If phishing attempts are successful, recipients will unknowingly click on links or images that send them to a spoofed source
Often times this is manifested as login pages or subscription signup forms</li>
<li>Hackers usually want victims to give them personally identifiable information such as their online banking credentials, street address, full name, social security number, credit card number, etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>What to Manually Check For</li>
<ul>
<li>Subject Line</li>
<li>Email address/phone number that the communications are originating from</li>
<li>Check for spelling or grammar errors in the message text</li>
<li>Look for odd or malformed logos</li>
<li>Hover over links without actually clicking them</li>
<li>Look out for messages that convey a threatening or “act fast!” tone</li>
<li><b>Legitimate message will NEVER ask for credit card, bank, or social security numbers</b></li>
<li><b>Look out for messages asking for/giving payment, special refund, coupon, or prizes</b></li>
</ul>
<li>When it doubt, throw it out (delete the message)</li>
</ul>

## What Tools Can Use to Protect Myself
<ul>
<li>Ask you email/text messaging service provider if they provide built-in spam/unknown message filters</li>
<li>Message filters scan the contents and will remove items from your inbox so you never have the chance to open a potential phishing messages</li>
<li>Most email providers (ex. Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) have built in options to enable filters for spam/phishing emails</li>
<li>Many modern phones (including the iPhone) can automatically warn you of potential malicious phone numbers if they call you</li>
</ul>

## Good Reminders
<ul>
<li>Never…</li>
<ul>
<li>click unknown links or call unknown phone numbers</li>
<li>end personal information, login credentials, or other sensitive information to any message you receive no matter the sender (even if legitimate)</li>
</ul>
<li>Always remember…</li>
<ul>
<li>to only accept messages from people/companies you know and trust</li>
<li>to be conscious of who you give you email and phone numbers to</li>
<li>that <b>NONE</b> of the automated tools <b>are a 100% safeguard!</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>

## What Can I Do If I Am A Victum
<ul>
<li>Don’t be afraid and report the incident to the appropriate person/group in your organization</li>
<ul>
<li>This will help them be aware of the situation and to let others know so they are do not fall victims also</li>
</ul>
<li>If you believe that your bank or other financial accounts were apart of the attack, call them immediately and close/freeze all the accounts</li>
<li>You can also report the attack to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who are watchdogs who will try to track down the culprit of the attack</li>
