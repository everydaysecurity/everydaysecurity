<h2>What should we do to prevent IPV?</h2>

Don’t be scared to state the IPV happened. Talk to the expert and treat it like a console, or mental therapeutics. Others could only know it when the issue being discussed and analyzed<br>

To prevent IPV, improving the level of security of devices is essential.<br>

•	Lock devices with a password to prevent others from getting into the device without your permission.<br>

•	Log out of accounts and apps so that if others do gain access to the device, they can't get the content in the apps.<br>

•	Be aware of who may accessing your device, and watch out any unfamiliar application and do not open suspicious links or apps.<br>

•	Protect the device with antivirus/antimalware software, althuogh they aren’t aiming for spy apps, they still doing a great job for about half of the malicious apps.<br>

•	Constantly check your device about settings and applications, especially for those require location, read/write, and sending message authority. <br>

<br>
When there is malicious post in social media, contect with the developer to save the evidence, contact with the company need to be fast since the data will be deleted within days. 

<br>
When there is likely a private information leak, report the abuse to the developer even if the information is not yours. Many online sites have policies against these actions and they will delete it.
