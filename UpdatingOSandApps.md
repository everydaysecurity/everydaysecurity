You have probably received pop-up notifications on your phone and computer telling you to update your operating system and applications. Chances are, you will click the “remind me later” button and forget about it. However, you should update your device as soon as possible to protect your device’s security. 

<h2>3 Reasons to Update Your OS & Applications on Time</h2>
- Software updates often contain critical software patches that close security holes. If you do not update your devices on time, it will be the same as leaving the door of your house open for anyone to come into. In this case, it will be easy for hackers to infiltrate and steal your data. Data such as your name and banking information that can be sold on the dark web.
- You also have to think about your friends, family, and coworkers. If a virus gets passed onto your device it can be passed to them as well. Updating your device helps to keep viruses from being downloaded on your device. 
- Software updates improve the performance of your device and applications on your device. It includes enhanced features such as more speed, stability, and advanced security options such as face recognition applications.

If you think you are going to forget updating your devices, it is a good idea to have automatic updates.

<h2>Automatically Updating Your Device’s Operating System</h2>
Android users have the option to choose a specific time they would like to download software updates on their devices.
Android:
- Go to “Settings”

Apple users cannot choose a specific time, but they can choose to update their devices overnight.

Apple:

There is no excuse, it only takes a few minutes to update your devices to keep them more protected and functional.
