<h2>How does Wi-Fi work?</h2>
Wi-Fi uses radio waves to provide network connectivity. The computer should include a wireless adapter that will translate data sent into a radio signal. This same signal will be transmitted, via an antenna, to a decoder known as the router. Once decoded, the data will be sent to the internet through a wired Ethernet connection. As the wireless network works as a two-way traffic, the data received from the internet will also pass through the router to be coded into a radio signal that will be received by the computer’s wireless adapter.
Approximately <strong>24.7%</strong> of Wi-Fi hotspots in the world do not use any encryption at all.

<h2>Where do we see public Wi-Fi?</h2>
Airport, restaurant, hotel, etc.

<h2>Why it can be dangerous?</h2>
* The biggest threat to free Wi-Fi security is the ability for the hacker to position himself between you and the connection point.
* Fake public Wi-Fi (very similar name, but fake)
* Possibly contains Malware
* Without password means unencrypted.
* When it comes to “personal” WPA2 attacks, the situation is similar to that of WPA and mostly depends on the strength of the password set by the hotspot owner.

<h2>What can we do to protect ourselves?</h2>
* Ask employee what the actual Wi-Fi is and what is the password.
* When connect to public Wi-Fi, have the file sharing system turn off.--- Otherwise, hackers can distribute malware to you.
* When connecting to public Wi-Fi, connect a [VPN (Virtual Private Network)](https://everydaysecurity.github.io/everydaysecurity/personalvpn/) first. This will encrypt message.
* Log out of any opened account.
* Turn off auto-connect to Wi-Fi. --- especially laptop.
* Do <strong>NOT</strong> log into financial accounts
